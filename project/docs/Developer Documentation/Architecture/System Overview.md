# System Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the NTG Ticket system architecture, including technology choices, system design principles, and high-level component interactions.

## 🎯 System Purpose

The NTG Ticket system is a comprehensive IT service management (ITSM) platform designed to streamline support operations, improve service quality, and provide detailed analytics for IT support teams.

### Core Objectives
- **Efficiency**: Streamline ticket management workflows
- **Transparency**: Provide real-time visibility into support operations
- **Scalability**: Support growing organizations and ticket volumes
- **Integration**: Connect with existing IT infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails and regulatory compliance

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### System Type
The NTG Ticket system follows a **Modular Monolith** architecture pattern, providing the benefits of microservices (modularity, maintainability) while avoiding the complexity of distributed systems.

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Modular Monolith**
- **Rationale**: Simplified deployment, easier development, better performance
- **Benefits**: Single deployment unit, shared database, simplified debugging
- **Trade-offs**: Less isolation between modules, potential for tight coupling

**2. GraphQL API**
- **Rationale**: Flexible data fetching, type safety, real-time subscriptions
- **Benefits**: Client-specific queries, reduced over-fetching, strong typing
- **Trade-offs**: Learning curve, potential performance issues with complex queries

**3. PostgreSQL Database**
- **Rationale**: ACID compliance, strong consistency, rich feature set
- **Benefits**: Reliable transactions, JSON support, excellent performance
- **Trade-offs**: Vertical scaling limitations, complexity for simple queries

```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Flow**
1. User provides credentials (email/password)
2. System validates credentials against database
3. JWT token generated with user information
4. Token returned to client for subsequent requests

**Authorization Model**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Four primary roles (End User, Support Staff, Manager, Admin)
- **Permission-Based Authorization**: Granular permissions for specific actions
- **Resource-Level Access**: Users can only access their own data or assigned tickets

**Security Measures**
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### Data Protection

**Encryption**
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **At Rest**: Database encryption, file storage encryption
- **Sensitive Data**: Password hashing, token encryption

**Audit Trail**
- Complete audit logging of all user actions
- Immutable audit records
- Compliance reporting capabilities
- Data retention policies

## 📊 Performance Architecture

### Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching**
1. **Browser Cache**: Static assets, API responses
2. **CDN Cache**: Global content distribution
3. **Application Cache**: Redis for frequently accessed data
4. **Database Cache**: Query result caching, connection pooling

**Cache Invalidation**
- Time-based expiration for static data
- Event-driven invalidation for dynamic data
- Manual cache clearing for critical updates
- Cache warming for frequently accessed data

### Database Optimization

**Query Optimization**
- Database indexing on frequently queried columns
