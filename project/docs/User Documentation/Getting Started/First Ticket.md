Title: Xerox 5500 printer showing "Paper Jam" error

Description:
The Xerox 5500 printer on the 3rd floor is showing a "Paper Jam" 
error message. The printer display shows error code E060-0002. 
I've checked all visible paper paths but cannot locate the jam.

The printer was working fine this morning, and the error appeared 
around 10:30 AM when I tried to print a 20-page document.

I've tried:
- Opening all access panels
- Checking the main paper tray
- Restarting the printer
- Clearing the print queue

Please help resolve this issue as multiple people use this printer.

Priority: High
Impact: Moderate (affects 3rd floor team)
```

### Software Issues

**Example: Application Crash**
```
Title: Excel crashes when opening large spreadsheets

Microsoft Excel 365 crashes immediately when I try to open 
spreadsheets larger than 5MB. The error occurs on both my 
laptop and desktop computer.

Error details:
- Application: Microsoft Excel 365
- Error message: "Excel has stopped working"
- Event ID: 1000 (from Windows Event Viewer)
